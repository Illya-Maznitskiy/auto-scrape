cd auto-scrape
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate (on Windows)

## Create Your Database
Make sure PostgreSQL is installed on your system.

## Steps:
1. Confirm PostgreSQL installation.
2. Open your terminal or PowerShell.
3. Connect to PostgreSQL using the `psql` command-line tool:
   ```bash
   psql -U postgres
   ```
Enter your password when prompted.
4. You should see something like this:
```
psql (17.5)
WARNING: Console code page (437) differs from Windows code page (1252)
         8-bit characters might not work correctly. See psql reference
         page "Notes for Windows users" for details.
Type "help" for help.
```
5. Create a new database called auto_scrape:
```bash
CREATE DATABASE auto_scrape;
```
6. Connect to your new database:
```bash
\c auto_scrape
````
You should see:
```
You are now connected to database "auto_scrape" as user "postgres".
```
Create the cars table with the following schema:
```bash
CREATE TABLE cars (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    url TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    price_usd INTEGER,
    odometer INTEGER,
    username TEXT,
    phone_number TEXT,
    image_url TEXT,
    images_count INTEGER,
    car_number TEXT,
    car_vin VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    datetime_found TIMESTAMP
);
```
